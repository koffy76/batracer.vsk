# batracer.local
A simple tool for converting [batracer](http://batracer.com/) setups between wet and dry weather. Written in [knockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/) and styled with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

## To use
1. Run the app via a web server
2. Enter your current car setup
3. Edit the setup changes as suggested by your "race engineer". If necessary, adjust the exact weather index. 
4. If the current set up was taken in the dry, then use the weather selector to select the weather for the next session (or vice versa).
5. Copy Team talk RAW text and paste into game team talk chat.

## Cheers
This program was made from [benhjt] (https://github.com/benhjt/batracer-setup) tool and modified for VSK.
