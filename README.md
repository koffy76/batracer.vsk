# batracer-setup
A simple tool for converting [batracer](http://batracer.com/) setups between wet and dry weather. Written in [knockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/) and styled with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

## To use
1. Run the app via a web server
2. Enter your completed car setup
3. Edit the setup changes as suggested by your "race engineer"
4. If the current set up was taken in the dry, then use the weather selector to select the weather for the next session (or vice versa).
5. Generate the adjusted setup!

## Future
I intend to change the weather section so that you choose the current weather condition and the future weather condition.
